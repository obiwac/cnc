# Z-axis

I opted to go for sdrautomation's pre-made linear actuator: <https://www.ebay.com/itm/304122024801>.

Unfortunately the seller was unable to provide a CAD model or detailed measurements, so now I've got my hands on one, I'll measure it up and create a model and upload it here.

Another thing to consider is that the seller is in Texas and I'm shipping this over to Belgium. Initially it was sent over by DHL for a shipping cost of over 200 EUR, but since DHL are losers, they lost my package and were unsure of it if was delivered or not, so I ended up having to wait nearly 6 months to receive my unit.
([Each](https://www.dhl.com/be-en/home/tracking.html) [one](https://www.dhlexpress.be/en/track-your-shipment/) [of](https://www.dhl.com/be-en/home.html) [their](https://mydhl.express.dhl/hk/en/tracking.html) [stupid](https://www.dhlecommerce.be/en/consumer/track-trace) [tracking](https://webtrack.dhlglobalmail.com/home) sites were either completely broken or said something different. There was also this old-ass 90's website which I couldn't find. DHL is shameful.)

## Other options considered

Another option I considered were these old NSK linear actuators: <https://www.ebay.com/itm/204119465105>, but I couldn't get very detailed specs on them and their ballscrew pitch seems too coarse for my needs.
