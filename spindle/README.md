# Spindle

My main requirements for the spindle were that it's variable (none of those fixed-speed routers that a lot of people use for hobby CNC's) and that it's plenty powerful enough (as this is perhaps surprisingly one of the comparatively least expensive components).

I decided to go with the [following spindle from StepperOnline](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/en-au/220v-1-5kw-80x73x175-5mm-air-cooled-spindle-motor-and-2hp-1-5kw-7-0a-variable-frequency-drive-kit-vsk-asl1-5b) (177.37 USD, including VFD), a VSK-ASL1.5B.
It's a 1.5 kW spindle, which already has a mounting block, uses ER11 collets, and doesn't need any special cooling (2.2 kW spindles are not all that much more expensive, but you start to require water cooling or at least a beefy heatsink + fan).
It also comes included with the VFD power supply (details in the electronics section).
