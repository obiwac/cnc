# CNC

This is a collection of acquired knowledge, resources, design documents (all in Blender, I am so sorry), and software for building my 3-axis CNC milling machine.

The primary goal of this project is to end up being able to very easily mill aluminium, and do so on the cheap.
I guess this project is similar to building a [PrintNC](https://wiki.printnc.info/en/home), except my focus will be on smaller-sized machining volume and aluminium (and possibly tougher metals) rather than wood routing.

**DISCLAIMER** I am far from an expert and am mainly doing this as a hobby project.
I know practically nothing of what I'm talking about!

## Goals and targets

- As stated above, be able to mill aluminium with ease.
- Not break the bank. Ideally I'd like to fall around the 2000 EUR mark, but my maximum budget is about 3000 EUR.
- Have an extremely easy to use software stack, with a nice web interface for uploading models (also in non-CAD formats, thinking of a Blender addon e.g.) and with nice WebGL job visualizations.
- Use a small number of relatively (where cost permits it) reliable suppliers.

## Roadmap

- [x] Design the machine.
- [x] Find suppliers for the parts.
- [x] Acquire the first batch of parts (VPSU, stepper PSU, steppers, spindle, Z-axis, speed controllers).
- [ ] Acquire the second batch of parts (ballscrews, linear rails, etc).
- [ ] Acquire the third batch of parts (bits, couplers, screws, endswitches, plates, etc).
- [ ] Design the electronics and the motherboard.
- [ ] Write the software stack.
- [ ] Actually assemble the darn thing.
- [ ] Probably plenty of experiments and plenty of testing ;)

## Videos

I'd like to document the entire process through a series of YouTube videos, but I'd like to at least get some of the software work done before I start doing that.
